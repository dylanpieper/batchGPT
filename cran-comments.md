## Resubmission (10/09/2024)

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

-   Written package names, software names, and API names in single quotes in the title and description fields as requested. For example: 'GPT', 'Claude', 'Gemini', 'shiny'. Also ensured that package names are case-sensitive where applicable.

-   Provided links to the web services/APIs/LLMs used in the DESCRIPTION file. The links are now formatted correctly with angle brackets for auto-linking (e.g., `<https://chat.openai.com>`).

-   Added `\value` tags to the `.Rd` files for exported methods, including documentation of the structure and meaning of the output. For functions that do not return a value, I have used the format `\value{No return value.}` as suggested for `man/batchLLM_shiny.Rd`.

-   Removed `cat()` as a method to write to the console. Where necessary, I have replaced `cat()` calls with `message()`, `warning()`, or `stop()` as appropriate in `R/batchLLM.R`.

All feedback has been addressed, and I have made the necessary adjustments for resubmission.
