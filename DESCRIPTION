Description: Batch process Large Language Model (LLM) text generation models on data frames with local storage and metadata, effortlessly loop across rows of a column and generate text completions with minimal supervision; the package currently supports OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, and Google Gemini models, with built-in delays for API etiquette, addressing challenges in text processing by offering features such as saving batches and metadata in a locally stored log file after each batch, comparing the output of different LLMs, and implementing a Shiny App Addin; use cases include natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis, thematic analysis, classification, labeling or tagging, and language translation.
