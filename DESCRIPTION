Version: 0.9.0
Author: Dylan Pieper

Description: Batch process Large Language Model (LLM) text generation models on data frames with local storage and metadata. 
            Effortlessly loop across rows of a column and generate text completions with minimal supervision. 
            The package currently supports OpenAI's GPT, Anthropic's Claude, and Google's Gemini models, with built-in delays for API etiquette. 
            The package streamlines text processing by providing advanced features, including automatic logging of batches and metadata to local files, side-by-side comparison of outputs from different large language models, and integration of a user-friendly Shiny App Addin.
            Use cases include natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis, thematic analysis, classification, labeling or tagging, and language translation.
