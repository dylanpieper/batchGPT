Title: batchLLM: Batch LLM completions in R and locally store output and metadata
Version: 0.9.0
Author: Dylan Pieper
Maintainer: The package maintainer <dylanpieper@gmail.com>
Description: The goal of batchLLM is to facilitate Large Language Model (LLM) operations on data frames in batches with local storage. Effortlessly loop across rows of a column and generate text completions on large datasets with minimal supervision. The package currently supports OpenAI GPT and Anthropic Claude models, with built-in delays for API etiquette. The package addresses challenges in text processing by offering features such as saving batches and metadata in a locally stored log file and implementing a Shiny App Addin. Use cases include sentiment analysis, thematic analysis, classification, labeling or tagging, and language translation. You can also compare the output of different LLMs.
